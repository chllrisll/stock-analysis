# stock-analysis
## **Overview of VBA_Challenge**
The Purpose of this analysis is to refactor code to loop and retrieve stock ticker data for all stock indexes in 2017 and 2018 at a more efficient speed.

## **Results**
Our Module 1 code ran at 0.7109375 seconds for the 2017 data set.

***The refactored code improved by 6/10's of a second***

## **Summary**
1. The advantages of refactoring code are apparent in improving speed/ performance but can also reduce complexeties for current and future understandings, furthering maintanability and scalability. At that same token there can be disadvantages in refactoring code mainly at the risk of intoroducing new bugs, increasing costs and time spent refactoring.
2. The pros and cons in our VBA_Analysis we saw that the refactored code imporoved the speed by 6/10's of a second. Luckily there were no consqequences in the refactoring of our Module 1 code.
